# Calculator-based-on-Tiva-MCU
(The code files contains core calculation function, Keypad and LCD driving functions, PIN initialization, animation functions)

This is a project that use TM4C123 Microcontroller interface with 4x4 keypad and 2004 LCD to make a complex functional calculator

*Schematic:*

The calculator is able to do *integer and decimal + - x / 10^n and complex brackets calculations*. The calculation logic is based on "Shunting Yard Logic".

*"ANS" and delete keys are also achieved* to make it more realistic. (picture shown below is linked to previous showcase for fundamental calculation)

Beside, this _calculator also contains password at starting page, and has function to reset password_.

To make it multi-functional, This *calculator is also be able to solve linear and quadratic equations*.
